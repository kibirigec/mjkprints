## üõ† Webhook System Features

### Development Testing
- **Automated endpoint testing** - Verifies webhook endpoint is accessible and configured
- **Event simulation** - Triggers test webhook events using Stripe CLI
- **Real-time monitoring** - Tracks webhook health and processing status
- **Environment validation** - Checks all required environment variables

### Production Support
- **Production setup guide** - Step-by-step Stripe Dashboard configuration

- **Error diagnostics** - Detailed troubleshooting for common issues
- **Security validation** - Ensures proper webhook signature verification

### Event Handling
The webhook system handles these critical events:
- `checkout.session.completed` - Processes completed payments
- `payment_intent.succeeded` - Confirms successful payments  
- `payment_intent.payment_failed` - Handles payment failures

## üìã Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Stripe Configuration (Required)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... # or sk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... # Different for dev/prod
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_... # or pk_live_...

# Application
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000 # or production URL

# Database (Required)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Email (Optional - graceful degradation)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG...
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

## üß™ Testing Workflow

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Run the setup assistant
npm run webhook:setup

# This will:
# - Check Stripe CLI installation
# - Authenticate with Stripe
# - Set up webhook forwarding
# - Configure environment variables
```

### 2. Test Endpoint Health
```bash
# Test webhook endpoint availability
npm run webhook:test

# Expected output:
# ‚úÖ Webhook endpoint is accessible
# ‚úÖ Environment variables configured
# ‚úÖ Database connection working
```

### 3. Start Development Mode
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start your development server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start webhook forwarding
npm run webhook:dev

# You should see:
# > Ready! Your webhook signing secret is whsec_...
```

### 4. Test Event Processing
```bash
# Simulate a successful checkout
npm run webhook:simulate checkout

# Or simulate specific events:
npm run webhook:simulate success   # payment_intent.succeeded
npm run webhook:simulate failed    # payment_intent.payment_failed
npm run webhook:simulate all       # All events
```

### 5. Monitor Webhook Status
```bash
# Check webhook health and recent events
npm run webhook:status

# Continuous monitoring (press Ctrl+C to stop)
npm run webhook:status monitor
```

## üîß Webhook Handler Details

The webhook handler at `/pages/api/webhooks/stripe.js` processes these events:

### Checkout Session Completed
```
1. Extracts order ID from session metadata
2. Updates order status to 'completed'
3. Creates time-limited download links
4. Sends confirmation email with downloads
5. Logs processing status
```

### Payment Intent Succeeded
```
1. Logs successful payment
2. Additional processing can be added here
```

### Payment Intent Failed
```
1. Logs payment failure
2. Can trigger retry logic or customer notification
```

## üîç Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Common Issues

| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| "Webhook secret not configured" | Run `npm run webhook:dev` and copy secret |
| "Invalid webhook signature" | Verify secret matches CLI output |
| "Failed to connect to localhost" | Ensure `npm run dev` is running |
| "Webhook events not received" | Check webhook forwarding is active |
| "Order not found" | Verify database schema and order creation |
| "Email delivery failed" | Check SendGrid configuration |

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Test webhook endpoint directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "webhook"}'

# List recent Stripe events
stripe events list

# View specific event details
stripe events retrieve evt_1234567890
```

## üîí Security Features

### Built-in Security
- **Signature verification** - All webhooks verified using Stripe signature
- **Environment isolation** - Separate secrets for development/production
- **Rate limiting** - Protection against webhook abuse
- **Data validation** - Validates event data before processing
- **Error handling** - Graceful error handling with proper HTTP status codes

### Security Best Practices
- Never log webhook secrets or sensitive data
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement idempotency for webhook processing
- Monitor for suspicious webhook activity
- Regularly rotate webhook secrets

## üìà Monitoring and Analytics

### Development Monitoring
```bash
# Real-time webhook monitoring
npm run webhook:status monitor

# View recent events
stripe events list --limit 10

# Check webhook forwarding status
stripe listen --list
```

### Production Monitoring
- Monitor webhook delivery in Stripe Dashboard
- Set up alerts for failed webhook deliveries
- Track webhook processing times
- Monitor order completion rates
